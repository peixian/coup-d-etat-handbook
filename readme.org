#+TITLE: Coup d'Etat - A Monkey Primer

The goal of this project is to gather info on coups in a holistic manner, drawing from both historical examples and political writings. 

While Africa has been the historical reference for /coups/, this project will mainly focus on Central Asia and the Middle East, as the nature of /coups/ has been transformed by recent technological changes. The Middle East /vis-a-vis/ the Arab spring, and the central Asian revolutions in the early 00's present more recent examples of /coups/.
